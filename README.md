Hi, I'm Thijs van Dijk.

I'm currently studying Computer Science in Rotterdam and I intend to use this Github page
to work on my own little projects.

I'm currently working on a 3D Model loader written in C and i will upload that when I feel
it's ready to be public.

I like working on low level coding applications and really enjoy optimization.

For any questions you can always email me at: thijs3214@gmail.com
